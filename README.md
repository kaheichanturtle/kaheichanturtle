# Hi, I'm Ka Hei! ðŸ‘‹
You can visit [my website](https://www.shorturl.at/v8TYg) for a short biography and projects I'm working on.

ðŸŽ“ High school student & aspiring software engineer  
ðŸ’¡ Passionate about AI, web dev, and problem-solving  
ðŸš€ Creator of [Healthmate](https://healthmate.glitch.me) | [ParkEase AI](https://parkease.glitch.me) | [Puzzle World Australia](https://puzzleworldaustralia.square.site)  

Important notice!
Glitch.com, the web provider of HealthMate and most of my projects, will be shutting down in July 2025. As a result, our project, HealthMate (formerly Ayako), and most of my projects, will no longer be updated and will quietly fade away and taken offline on July. Thank you for being part of our journey, especially during the Knox Grammar - Macquarie University Global Challenge Week. I'll try to update or include the source code of the projects I made here or to another web hosting site, but for now I'm gonna take a break from this!
