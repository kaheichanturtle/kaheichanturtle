# Hi, I'm Ka Hei! 👋
You can visit [my website](https://www.shorturl.at/v8TYg) for a short biography and projects I'm working on.

🎓 High school student & aspiring software engineer  
💡 Passionate about AI, web dev, and problem-solving  
🚀 Creator of [Healthmate](https://healthmate.glitch.me) | [ParkEase AI](https://parkease.glitch.me) | [Puzzle World Australia](https://puzzleworldaustralia.square.site)  

Important notice!
Glitch.com, the web provider of HealthMate and most of my projects, will be shutting down in July 2025. Moreover, with the recent release of MedGemma (https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/medgemma/), we’re entering a new era of open source, offline medical AI that can handle images and much more. As a result, our project, HealthMate (formerly Ayako), will no longer be updated and will quietly fade away. Thank you for being part of our journey, especially during the Knox Grammar - Macquarie University Global Challenge Week. With smarter, offline medical AI now available, everyone will soon have access to a doctor, even without internet.
